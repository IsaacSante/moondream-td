# Moondream-td
Realtime object detection with no data training using moondream vlm, then pipe the data into TouchDesigner.
Requires python and Touchdesigner.


Currently using a mac laptop running main.py to get camera feed.

And an nvidia windows pc for model detection running server.py

Detection data is then piped into TD and used in conjunction with the MediaPipe plugin.
